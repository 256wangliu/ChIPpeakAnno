<center> <h1>The tutorial to use ChipSeq</h1> </center>


##Set up environment

Install the following softares firstly:

+ ngsplt(https://github.com/shenlab-sinai/ngsplot)

+ MACS(https://github.com/taoliu/MACS)

##
```{r eval=FALSE


}



+ Run ChipSeq to perform one-setp analysis for ChipSeq related data 

```{r eval=FALSE}

 
```

+ Convert the results of differential usage analysis into gene based resutls

```{r eval=FALSE}

```

+ Apply logistic regression model to identify bias factor
```{r eval=TRUE}

```

+ Perform pathwaysplice in one step
```{r eval=TRUE}


```

+ If you are interested in other gene sets such as Canonical Pathways(CP),Transcription Factor Targets(TFT) and hallmark gene sets from http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/collections.jsp, download these .gmt files, then perform the following steps:
```{r eval=TRUE}

```

+ Build up network based on the overlap between gene sets and visualize this network

```{r eval=TRUE}

```
